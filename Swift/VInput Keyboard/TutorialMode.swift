    // 7) Two finger tap -> read back letter
    // 8) Two finger hold -> read back current word

For example, the letter A is left of B and the letter D is right of C. To spell a word, you will search along the alphabet to find each letter. VInput will prompt you with a letter. Swipe left or right of the prompted letter toward the letter you are looking for. Swipe up to select the current letter. Swipe up now to test these gestures. Swipe right to move on to the next section.",

To capitalize a letter, hold down on the screen with one finger until VInput tells you your letter has been capitalized, then swipe up to select the letter. The capitalization will only affect the current letter you are on. Swiping past the letter will reset letters in the search to lower case. Swipe up now to test this gesture.
